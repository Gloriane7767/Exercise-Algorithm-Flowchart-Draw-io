## Exercise 1
A program that:
- Takes two number
- Compares them
- Display the larger number
- End

  ✔ Pseudocode
  
        START
          INPUT number1
          INPUT number2
           IF number1 > number2 THEN
        DISPLAY number1, "is larger"
        ELSE IF number2 > number1 THEN
        DISPLAY number2, "is larger"
        ELSE
        DISPLAY "Both numbers are equal"
        ENDIF
        END

## Exercise 2
A program that:

- Prompts user to enter 5 numbers
- Keeps a running total
- Displays the sum
- Ends program


✔ Pseudocode

    START
        total = 0
        REPEAT 5 TIMES
            INPUT number
            total = total + number
        ENDREPEAT
        PRINT "Total sum = ", total
    END

## Exercise 3

A program asks the user to enter their age.

- If age is 18 or older, display: "You are eligible to vote"
  
- If age is less than 18, display: "You are not eligible to vote"
  
- End the program.



✔ **Pseudocode** 

    START
        INPUT age
        IF age >= 18 THEN
            PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
        ELSE
            PRINT "You are not eligible to vote."
        ENDIF
    END

## Exercise 4

 program takes student marks (0–100).

- 90 and above → Grade A
- 75–89 → Grade B
- 50–74 → Grade C
- Below 50 → Fail

✔ **Pseudocode** 

    START
        INPUT marks
        IF marks >= 90 THEN
            PRINT "Grade A"
        ELSE IF marks >= 75 THEN
            PRINT "Grade B"
        ELSE IF marks >= 50 THEN
            PRINT "Grade C"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Fail"
        ENDIF
    END

## Exercise 5

A program that:

    Takes A, B, C as inputs
    Finds the largest
    Displays result
    Ends program

✔ Pseudocode

A program that:

- Takes A, B, C as inputs  
- Finds the largest  
- Displays result  
- Ends program


✔ Flowchart

    START
        INPUT A
        INPUT B
        INPUT C
        IF A >= B AND A >= C THEN
            PRINT "A is largest"
        ELSE IF B >= A AND B >= C THEN
            PRINT "B is largest"
        ELSE
            PRINT "C is largest"
        ENDIF
    END
